      <h1> Welcome to the new Foobt Site!</h1>
      <p> As you can see, we've made a few changes... So this page
      will act as a guide to help you get accustomed to the new 
      foobt site!</p>

      <h2> NAVIGATION!!!!</h2>
      <p>Navigation through the site can be done by moving your mouse
      to the left side of the screen!<br> Moving your mouse away from 
      the left side will hide the menu again! Pretty cool right?!</p>

      <h2> Sub-NAVIGATION!!!!</h2>
      <p>The old foobt site allowed you to sub-navigate your classes with 
      options like, schedule, assignments, links, and your class syllabus.
      <br> This can still be found as soon as you enter your class section
      from the landing page, you will see a more tradition navigation near the 
      top of the screen to navigate through your class options!</p>

      <h2> Smart-Device/ Mobile!</h2>
      <p> A native IOS/Android application is currently being developed for foobt!<br>
      however until then you can navigate a responsive version of the site (Coming soon..)
      by swipping from the left side the menu will become visible allowing you to 
      use the site as you would from a PC!</p>
